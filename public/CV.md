## Education

**University of Birmingham**, Birmingham, UK - `Sep 2019 - Jun 2022`

**BSc Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science** - First Class Honours
- **Final Year Project**: Semi‑Supervised Learning with Pseudo‑labelling and Synthetic Samples. Where I investigated the effectiveness of using synthetic samples generated from a Generative Adversarial Network and pseudo‑labelling technique for the task of improving image classification accuracy on the CIFAR‑10 dataset.
- Led a team project on semantic segmentation on cardiovascular MR images with a custom U‑Net architecture. Achieved Dice coefficient of 0.8.
- Designed and built a demining robot that sweeps the environment to identify toy land mines and remove them. Built with Lego EV3, ultrasonic/color sensor and OpenRoberta.
- Robot Supermarket Assistance, a group project where we designed and implemented a robot with ROS, that would build a map of the supermarket using SLAM and QR code to locate grocery aisles and traverse to the given aisle with the Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm upon request.
- Group project where we designed the specifications for a remote learning platform whilst employing software engineering practices (e.g. Scrum,
requirements engineering, UML diagrams and testing strategies).

**University of Zurich**, Online - `Jul 2020`

**Deep Dive In Blockchain Summer School**
-  Final group project where we established a non‑fungible sharing economy token. Covered the business model, implementation and legal
challenges which the token could face. I am also responsible for developing the Ethereum NFT (ERC‑721) smart contract for the token.

**St. David's Catholic College**, Cardiff, UK - `Sep 2017 - Jul 2019`
- Math (A), Business (A), Chinese (A*), Information Technology (Distinction*), Welsh Bacc (B)

**Kings Monkton School**, Cardiff, UK - `Nov 2015 - Jul 2017`
- 13 GCSEs, including Maths Numeracy/Math (A*/A) and English (C)

## Extracurricular Activity

**Birmingham Environment for Academic Research (BEAR) Challenge 2022**, Birmingham, UK - `Jun 2022`
- Placed 1st out of 7 teams.
- Challenges involve utilising the Baskerville Tier 2 HPC system to speed up the data engineering pipeline with Dask dataframe, and deep learning
training with multiple GPUs using Horovod.
- Designed an energy/cost‑efficient HPC cluster with 15 server racks, where our design was the most efficient

**UKMT’s Math Challenge**, Cardiff, UK - `2017`
- Silver Certificate
